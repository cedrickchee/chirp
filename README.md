# Chirp

Chirp is a real-time Twitter clone with LiveView and Phoenix 1.6.

This project is my version from the 'code along' with Chris McCord post: ["Build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes with LiveView and Phoenix 1.6"](https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5)

This repo is complete with everything up through the 'mix phx.server' command including the LiveView routes are in place. The "mix setup" takes care of both "mix ecto.create" and "mix ecto.migrate".

## Usage

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
